            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2> Web developer <span>& Designer</span></h2>
            <p>Hello! I am passionate web developer with a knack for building dynamic, responsive, and visually engaging
                websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in creating seamless user
                experiences that work beautifully across all devices. I’m constantly exploring new technologies and
                frameworks to keep my skills sharp and my projects modern.

                I believe that the best websites combine functionality with creativity, and I strive to achieve that
                balance in every project. Whether I'm working on a small business site, an e-commerce platform, or a
                personal blog, I’m dedicated to writing clean, efficient code and delivering solutions that meet both
                client and user needs.

                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me [mention any relevant hobbies, e.g., learning new programming
                languages, exploring design trends, or contributing to open-source projects]. I’m always open to
                collaboration, so feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together!

                Thanks for visiting my site—let’s make the web a more engaging place!
